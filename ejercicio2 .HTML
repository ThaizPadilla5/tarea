        Nobody’s born smart. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, <em> riding </em> a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a <em>time</em> when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his<strong> ABCs</strong> just like the rest of us.<br>
         <em>Thankfully </em>, we are born to <em> learn </em>.<br>
       <strong> Slowly</strong>. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, <em> fall </em> and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating.<strong> Confusing</strong>. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One  <em>foot  </em>in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong  <em>answer </em> making your brain a little bit<strong> stronger</strong>.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can <strong>learn</strong> anything.
